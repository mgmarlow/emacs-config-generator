;;; init.el --- Emacs configuration -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Save the contents of this file to ~/.config/emacs/init.el and
;; you're ready to boot up Emacs.

;; Hack this file! One of the best ways to get started with Emacs is
;; to look at other peoples' configurations and extract the pieces
;; that work for you. That's where this configuration started. I
;; encourage you to read through the code in this file and explore the
;; functions and variables using the built-in help system (details
;; below). Happy hacking!

;; "C-<chr>  means hold the CONTROL key while typing the character <chr>.
;; Thus, C-f would be: hold the CONTROL key and type f." (Emacs tutorial)

;; Performance tweaks for modern machines
(setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000) ; 100 mb
(setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) ; 1mb

;; Remove extra UI clutter by hiding the scrollbar, menubar, and toolbar.
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)

;; Set the font. Note: height = px * 100
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "{{ font_family }}" :height 120)

;; Add unique buffer names in the minibuffer where there are many
;; identical files. This is super useful if you rely on folders for
;; organization and have lots of files with the same name,
;; e.g. foo/index.ts and bar/index.ts.
(require 'uniquify)

;; Automatically insert closing parens
(electric-pair-mode t)

;; Visualize matching parens
(show-paren-mode 1)

;; Prefer spaces to tabs
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

;; Automatically save your place in files
(save-place-mode t)

;; Save history in minibuffer to keep recent commands easily accessible
(savehist-mode t)

;; Keep track of open files
(recentf-mode t)

;; Keep files up-to-date when they change outside Emacs
(global-auto-revert-mode t)

;; Display line numbers only when in programming modes
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'display-line-numbers-mode)

;; The `setq' special form is used for setting variables. Remember
;; that you can look up these variables with "C-h v variable-name".

      backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,(concat user-emacs-directory "backups")))
      ;; I'll add an extra note here since user customizations are important.
      ;; Emacs actually offers a UI-based customization menu, "M-x customize".
      ;; You can use this menu to change variable values across Emacs. By default,
      ;; changing a variable will write to your init.el automatically, mixing
      ;; your hand-written Emacs Lisp with automatically-generated Lisp from the
      ;; customize menu. The following setting instead writes customizations to a
      ;; separate file, custom.el, to keep your init.el clean.
      custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))

;; Bring in package utilities so we can install packages from the web.
(require 'package)

;; Add MELPA, an unofficial (but well-curated) package registry to the
;; list of accepted package registries. By default Emacs only uses GNU
;; ELPA and NonGNU ELPA, https://elpa.gnu.org/ and
;; https://elpa.nongnu.org/ respectively.

;; A quick primer on the `use-package' function (refer to
;; "C-h f use-package" for the full details).
;;
;; (use-package my-package-name

;;   :after foo   ; Load my-package after foo is loaded (seldom used)
;;   :init        ; Run this code before my-package is loaded
;;   :bind        ; Bind these keys to these functions
;;   :custom      ; Set these variables
;;   :config      ; Run this code after my-package is loaded

;; Minibuffer completion is essential to your Emacs workflow and
;; Vertico is currently one of the best out there. There's a lot to
;; dive in here so I recommend checking out the documentation for more
;; details: https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/vertico.html. The short and
;; sweet of it is that you search for commands with "M-x do-thing" and
;; the minibuffer will show you a filterable list of matches.
